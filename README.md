# LinkedIn_Job_postings_data_Analysis

# Introduction
The objective of this project was to analyze job postings data from LinkedIn in Germany and gain insights into the data science job market in the country.
# Data sources
I collected data from LinkedIn using Python's Selenium library and cleaned it using the pandas library. The dataset comprised 203 job postings from various companies and locations in Germany.
Techniques Used
To extract meaningful information from the job descriptions, I utilized semantic analysis techniques. This allowed me to identify the most in-demand skills in the data science field. The results were visualized using a word cloud, providing a clear representation of the key skills.
# Dashboard and Visualizations
To present the insights effectively, I created a dashboard using Tableau. The powerful data visualization capabilities of Tableau allowed me to showcase the trends and patterns in the data. The dashboard includes various charts, graphs, and visualizations, providing a comprehensive overview of the job market in Germany.
